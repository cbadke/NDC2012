Team Leader Manifesto
Roy Osherove
@royosherove

Why another manifesto?
There is a disconnect between agile values and our real actions.

-----
We believe
Great Teams Are Grown, Not Hired.

The goal of a team leader is to *continuously grow* the skills of
the people in their team to the point of self-organization.

We make time for the team to learn and be challenged.
Instead of filling up 100% of the time with production work 

We take risks for our team instead of staying safe

We emphasize honing new skills
instead of always optimizing current skills and knowledge

We experiment as a constant practice
Instead of just maintaining the status quo
	with people
	with tools
	with processes
	with the environment


------

don't act as a victim of a world you can't control
you are paid to change the world around you, if you don't change that world you're not doing your job


"Management, done right, is a very tough job"

happier teams make happier customers and employers.

Is each person in my team better this week than the week before in some new skill?
Can they solve more of their own problems?

Self-organization is realy hard and requires a strong skill-set. You can't just throw people in a room and tell them to self-organize.

Challenge ourselves and our teams to become better, get outside your comfort zone.
- simply learning a new framework doesn't count. not outside of comport zone.

You always want to be where you feel stupid because that means you are learning something

***it takes time to learn new skills. it will slow people down while they are learning BUT will improve them in the long run

People say:
We don't have time for this!
This will not work for my team.

Leadership style has to change based on the state of the team.

A team in chaos needs a different leader than a self-organizing team. **** this is a really good topic in his book
The art of leadership is recognizing what a team needs at any given time.

---

three states of teams. teams constantly rotate between these:
chaos - no time for new things. scrambling to get things done. putting out fires.
	- agile doesn't really work in chaotic state
	- number one priority is to get out of chaos
	- leader needs to take control. (commander)
		- be kind of a dictator. 
		- shield the team. 
		- when the ship is sinking the captain doesn't call a meeting he gives orders
learning - slack time available and teams are allowed to learn new things
	- leader becomes more of a coach
		- give people opportunity to solve their own problems
self-organizing - team can solve all their own problems
	- leader isn't needed all the time (facilitator)
		- can disappear for a week and things keep humming along

a team can fall into chaos with a day
- situations change
- leader needs to learn how to recognize the team states and adjust

treat a chaotic team as a self-organizing team and you will create more chaos
treat a learning or organizing team as chaotic they will become unhappy/frustrated


Chaos Addiction - people stay in chaos because they are in chaos and don't recognize

I've been reading it, it's a work in progress but it seems pretty good so far.
