He has questions and no real answers...

We are so used to software being wrong we don't even notice anymore

The shrinking of delivery phases need to make us rethink
- analogy using satnav for a 5 minute trip isn't helpful (takes 10 to find satellites)

Software quality is sometimes information art.
Giving users the right information can change the perception of quality. Setting expectations can greatly change the 'quality' of a system.

Look up paper: WaterScrumFall

Quality is related to three things:
accurate, relevant, timely information
Today people are very accurate (stats and stats, bug counts, code coverage etc)
whens the last time anyone made any real decisions based on those metrics?
How do we inform better decisions?

when you say quality business hears cost.
why would i pay for refactoring?

how do we reposition software quality?
need to frame quality around business needs


this is a squishy talk and not really good for note taking
very interesting and probably a candidate for movie monday
