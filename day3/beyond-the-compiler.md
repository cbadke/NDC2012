Beyond the Compiler - Going up to 11 with conventions in a statically typed language
Krzysztof Kozmic
@kkozmic


convention: an agreed upon approach to perform a task

twitter adopted conventions from users:
@ and # grew out of the users

static typing make intellisense and resharper work

we can rely on the compiler to help up find problems
- BUT you can't rely on the compiler for everything

compiler does not do validation as a primary function
the compiler is for converting code to machine code

**** rewatch this - hard to absorb but interesting ***
