cynefin framework
simple vs complicated problems
	- cause -> effect relationships
Complex vs chaotic
	- no useful cause -> effect relationship

problems start as disorder (you can't identify which of the four)
	- you will naturally assume the problem is the type that you tend to like

different orgs map to these categories as well and those orgs are effective at solving different types of problems

complex problems are where the $$ at
